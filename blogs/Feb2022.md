### 1/29: Meeting with WA Legislator
The WA STEM Advocacy group contacted dozens of legislators across our state to schedule a meeting to discuss FIRST funding. On January 29th, we lobbied for FIRST funding and shared our FIRST experiences to the Legislative Assistant of WA Senate Majority Leader Andy Billig. Since they are located in Spokane, they were not heavily exposed to FIRST. After we introduced the program, showed our robot, and explained a match to show the collaboration and teamwork within alliances, the legislative assistant was willing to bring this up with Senator Billig to see how best to provide more funding for teams through Senate Bill 5092 Section 522 and a building in Kent. He was extremely friendly, seemed impressed by our work, asked a lot of questions, and even asked how he could help our mission.We have several more meetings scheduled in the coming months.

On January 28th, we interviewed Laura LeBlanc, an Upper School Science Faculty member at The Bush School where she teaches Chemistry, Environmental Science, and Regional Geology of the PNW. Prior to teaching at Bush, she taught science at Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences (SAAS). Laura talked about her research when pursuing graduate studies in Glaciology, and what made her so interested in those topics. She talked about how her curiosity as a child evolved to her becoming a teacher in STEM, and the importance of teaching STEM to children. Furthermore, she mentioned her experiences as a woman in STEM, and at the end, what made her love teaching so much. Lauraâ€™s presentation emphasized the importance of STEM in early education and how teaching others about STEM is something that she loves.

### 1/17: Washington State STEM Advocacy - Lobby Day Training
WA STEM Advocacy is a sub-organization within Everstem Education established by **FIRST FTC Team 18225 High Definition** to advocate for awareness and increased funding towards FIRST robotics programs and STEM extracurricular activities.

This Training Day is the first major event held by our group to teach 50 WA students how the WA government works, what STEM advocacy is, and how to do it. We specifically introduced the students to Senate Bill 5092 Section 522 for FIRST funding, why it matters, and how we can support it. After the training, students will get the opportunity to lobby and share their experiences with legislators to support the bill.

The Student Association Association for STEM Advocacy (SASA) provided segments on STEM Advocacy 101 and How to Have Effective Meetings with legislators.

### 1/8: Connecting with Professionals: Anne Kao - Artificial Intelligence & Robotics
On January 8th, we interviewed Anne Kao, an Executive Consultant at the Collinear Group. She was a Senior Technical Fellow in Boeing where she worked for 30 years. Ms. Kao discussed Artificial Intelligence, examples that we have seen in real life, and how it became what it is today. In the second half of her presentation she talked about how artificial intelligence can be used in robotics, including which parts people should pay attention to. Many people found this talk extremely educational and gave them a good footing on what artificial intelligence really is.
