# October 2021
Hi everyone! This is Everstem Education's first monthly blog post. Every month, we'll share some highlights from the previous month, starting from this past October.

### FTC 18225 Website with FTC Handbooks
In collaboration with FIRST FTC Team 18225 High Definition, we are providing a beginning handbook for FTC Mechanical Design and Programming, which can be found here:

Additionally, High Definition has recently published their website through the Everstem domain, which you can find at [https://ftc18225.everstem.org/](https://ftc18225.everstem.org/)

If you're interested in collaborating with or just connecting with High Definition, you can contact them at ftc18225@gmail.com! If you're a robotics team interested in collaborating with Everstem, contact us at contact@everstem.org

### 10/26 - Experiences as a Researcher and Physicist- Gwynne Crowder
On October 26th, we interviewed Gwynne Crowder, a physics professor at Bellevue College with many accomplishments, including: launching a rocket into space to study hot gases, searching for remnants of life in Antarctica, and studying gravitational waves deep underground.

Professor Crowder discussed the history of gravitational waves and how it has revealed a new perspective on astronomy research. Additionally, she introduced new technologies such as LIGO, which utilizes lasers to detect gravitational waves in outer space. With a personal interest in physics and astronomy among our audience, Professor Crowder was able to inspire many STEM students to pursue this field despite the initial setbacks, an important message to future scientists

### 10/9-10 - College App Walkthrough
On October 9th and 10th, we hosted a free 1-hour college application walkthrough through Zoom. We understand that it's very easy to feel overwhelmed with all the college deadlines, and we wanted to help make the application process more manageable.

Our first day focused on getting started and setting up accounts on the Common App and/or Coalition. On the second day, we went over how to fill out the activities list along with some general tips and tricks. The walkthroughs were conducted one-on-one and were largely discussion-based. This provided us with more flexibility and we were able to better cater our advice to each individual.

### 10/5 - Microsoft Outreach
On October 5th, we introduced Everstem and our mission to 70+ Microsoft employees in the Microsoft DevRel GX All-Hands event. We shared our programs, as well as ways they could help students. We concluded the event by giving everyone an opportunity to volunteer for half an hour by doing activities such as sharing their story in STEM (which you can read below!).

### All-Hands story from Arthur Yasinski (General Manager, Microsoft Corporation):
I grew up in a hamlet (which is smaller than a village) in northern Alberta in Canada. My nearest neighbors were on an adjacent farm 1/2 mile away, and we only had one TV channel. The primary industries in my area were farming, oil and gas, and forestry. Technology wasn't very prevalent in my daily life, but my favorite subject in school was math. While I thoroughly enjoyed living on a farm, I knew that I wanted to go to post-secondary education, and early on, my dream was to be a lawyer.

That changed during a school trip. I was also part of our school's band program, and while I was in high school, we did a weekend exchange program with another band in a city that was 10 hours away. I ended up sleeping on a sofa bed at the exchange family and noticed that they had a TRS-80 color computer. As intrigued as I was with the device, I didn't want to touch it, so I took advantage of the manuals sitting on the coffee table and spent my evenings (when I was supposed to be sleeping) reading and learning about the computer. I also learned about BASIC.

When I got home to the farm, I convinced my family to help me save for my very own computer. After many chores and months of saving, I had enough to buy a TRS-80 Model III for myself. Each night I would finish my farm work and then my homework and race to the computer to immerse myself in all its wonderment. This was new for me and for everyone around me. It was addicting and gratifying at the same time. Shortly after getting the computer, I realized I was spending upwards of 30 hours on it. I thought to myself, if I only did another 10 hours per week, this could be my career.

Which is what I ultimately ended up doing. I attended university and obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computing Science. From there, I got a job as a computer-based bookkeeper for a local ice supply company and then as a computer programmer for a scientific research lab, all the while experimenting and playing with the technology beyond what was required of my job. I eventually shared some code on how to integrate Oracle and the internet...before, the internet was a thing, which led me to work for Oracle, and then ultimately for Microsoft. I have been with Microsoft for 24 years, and each day is as unique and challenging as the first.

A career in STEM is like a blank notebook. There are guides and rules, but the story is yours to write. There are endless opportunities to learn, collaborate, and innovate. I am forever grateful for the set of circumstances that introduced me to this career, and I still love what I do decades later.
