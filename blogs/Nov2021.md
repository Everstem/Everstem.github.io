### 11/21: Connecting with Professionals: Shaw Li
On November 21st, we interviewed Xiaopeng (Shaw) Li, an associate professor at the University of Florida who is currently the Susan A. Bracken (first holder) Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and is the director of a USDOT National University Transportation Center, National Institute for Congestion Reduction. 

Professor Li discussed Connected Automated Vehicles and their positive impacts on transportation, such as safety and being eco-friendly. He introduced many projects that he has worked on, one of them being a test of connected vehicles sensors inspired by how animals communicate with color. The unique and innovative ideas Professor Li has brought to light have definitely influenced our audience greatly, opening their eyes to the more creative parts of STEM and engineering.

He discussed the aspects of pedestrian safety and impacts of AI applications. He introduced one of the new sensors from STAR Lab that they created, called the Mobile Unit for Sensing Traffic (MUST) sensor, which aimed to create safer and smarter roads. In his presentation, Professor Wang was able to capture advanced ideas and aspects of transportation that inspired watchers and listeners, an important mindset to have for future people in STEM.

### 11/4-5 Business/Startup Consulting
On November 4th-5th, students in Tesla STEM High School’s Engineering 3 class presented a Market Research analysis of Everstem Education to our organization’s leadership. They performed a competitive analysis that compared us to existing organizations and created a chart that helped visualize it. Some things that differentiated us from others was: our status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, being a student-run organization, having a small student to teacher ratio, and conducting interactive lessons/activities.

Based on their research, they recommended branching out to more schools and making our name more well known. We will be taking this into consideration for our future workshops as we continue to plan more events. 

### 11/2: Business and Marketing Class SWOT Analysis
On November 2nd, students in Tesla STEM High School’s Business and Marketing class presented a SWOT analysis of Everstem Education to our organization’s leadership.

We will be taking their recommendations of branching out to in-person education (especially since it’s safer now) and different forms of advertisement.
