On Sunday, December 19th, we interviewed Osama Osman, an Assistant Professor of Intelligent Transportation Systems and Data Analytics in the Department of Civil and Chemical Engineering (CCE) and the Mobility Thrust Lead in the Center for Urban Informatics and Progress at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC). Professor Osman spoke about a community of autonomous systems enthusiasts, professors, and researchers, etc, called F1TENTH. He mentioned itâ€™s missions, such as Build, Learn, Race, and Research. He showed a robot that he and his students made for this mission, surrounding the goal of getting hands-on experience with building autonomous robots. With great enthusiasm, Professor Osman introduced an opportunity for students to learn about autonomous vehicles and the ability to get hands-on experience, surely inspiring and educating the STEM community that was able to attend this talk.
